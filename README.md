# Summary
Python2-based bulk downloader that will download the game data.

Game of War has a file called `manifest`, which contains all the game data. Some data are on the root tree, and other are packaged on *.ibx files. The manifest and the *.ibx files are automatically generated by a `Jenkins` tool.

This script first downloads the manifest, and then all the associated files within it.

# Requisites
Works with `Python 2.7`.

# Usage
Run `main.py`, it will download and create a `manifest.json` file if not present, and create a `data` folder to download all files from the game if not present.

# Roadmap
- Multiprocessing to download faster.
- Use colorama for user-friendliness.
- Unpack *.ixb files (they are just zip files), and dump contained data.
- Decompile *.luac files in *.ixb packages.
- Investigate where root *.luac files come from.
- Investigate where some root *.rml files come from.
